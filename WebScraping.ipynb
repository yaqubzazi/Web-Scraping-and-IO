        "- This last chunk of code had a lot to it so I will break it down. To edit and analyze different columns or rows of data in the data frame, the column or row has to be called upon in the code. When looking at the column name with the original `data` command, there are spaces in all the columns but the column of interest was Annual % Change. There would be a syntax error if you were to use something along the lines of data.Annual % Change. Using the `data.columns` functions can help provide what the names are for the columns but that also ran into an error because it would not provide the full column name and instead substitute it with **...** after character limit was reached.\n",
        "- I then assigned the variable `columns` into a list and manually chose the column by printing the 7th value, which is the Annual % Change column. The code then returns that long name and now we finally get to see just that specific column. There were a couple of problems however. The % signs that were in the column values were making the values a string and using the `min` function and the `describe` function, Python could not calculate the right values or did not calculate anything at all.\n",
        "- With those issues what had to be done was the % sign to be removed from the values and then the values are set to be a float. That helped determine the correct `min` and `max` values. Then the `percent_change` variable is set to equal the columns with the % change, which then became a factor with the `.describe` function.\n"
